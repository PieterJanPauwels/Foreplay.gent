# Apps For X Light



###Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to Apps For X Light.

This repository is meant as a lightweight website template that 
people can use for the hackathons they are organizing, or if they don't really have all too much time to put in their website.

Before we go ahead, there are several colors from which you can use to easily edit your theme. You may use these
and the classes they are used in freely, but you might want to change them to fit the colors
that are being used in the styleguide of your hackathon. [check out our demo!](http://openknowledgebe.github.io/AppsForXLight/) for an example.

If you find the functionalities lacking, feel free to check out:

This has more eloborate functionalities, like a blog, showcase, twitter wall and what not. 

Other than that, feel free to fork if you have improvements or want to work further upon this. Cheers!
