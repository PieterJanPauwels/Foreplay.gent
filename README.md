# Foreplay Conferentie

This repository is meant as a lightweight website template that people can use for different projects.

Before we go ahead, there are several colors from which you can use to easily edit your theme. You may use these
and the classes they are used in freely, but you might want to change them to fit the colors
that are being used in your styleguide of your hackathon.
